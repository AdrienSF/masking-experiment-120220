# masking-experiment-120220

## Participants
A total of xx healthy volunteers will be included in the experiment. Participants will be excluded in
the following cases: (a) report not perceiving any faces/houses in phase two; (b) not having enough
trials (n=80) in each experimental cell due to excessive artefacts or eye movements; or (c) showing
no N170 in phase three. Participants will be recruited if they report normal or corrected-to-normal
vision and no history of neurological conditions. They will provide informed consent prior to
participating, and will participate for either course credit or payment.

## Stimuli
All stimuli will be presented on a 1920 x 1080 TFT LCD VPIXX display monitor with a refresh
rate of 120 Hz using matlabâ€™s Psychtoolbox 3.0. They include 24 simple line drawings of faces and
houses used by Schurger et al. (2015). The drawings are black, presented grey background (RGB:
180, 180, 180). Additional noise was added to the stimuli by randomly selecting 25% of the pixels
and replacing their color from black to grey or vice versa. In addition, noise stimuli will be prepared
for each of the stimuli by randomly selecting 50% of the pixels and performing the same
replacement as described above. A checkerboard display will be used as a mask. All stimuli
will be presented at 6 X 6 degrees of visual angle (DVA). Finally, a red (RGB: 200, 0, 0) circle with
a 0.5 DVA radius will serve as a probe.

Figure 1. Experimental procedure of the conscious (A) and unconscious (B) sessions. A
Face/House/Noise stimulus will be presented for 33 ms, preceded and followed by a 96 ms
mask presented centrally at fixation. In the conscious sessions, the masks will be separate from
the critical stimuli by a 96ms blank, while no blank will be used in the unconscious condition.
In 15% of the trials of both sessions (illustrated here in panel B), a red probe will be presented
at a random location on the surface of the critical stimulus, remaining on screen during the
and second blank (conscious) or mask (unconscious).

## Procedure
The experiment will include five blocks of 126 trials (42 faces, 42 houses, 42 noise stimuli, so that
each stimulus repeated four times within a block). Half the trials will belong to the conscious
condition, and half to the unconscious condition, randomly intermixed. Participants will be given
self-paced rest breaks after every block. Trial onset will also be self-paced.
In each trial, a 992 ms fixation will be followed by a 96 ms mask, which in turn will be followed
by the critical stimulus (Face/House/Noise), presented for 32 ms. Then, another mask will be 
presented for 96 ms. In the conscious condition, the masks will be separate from the critical stimulus
by 96 ms blanks (Figure 1).
On ~15% of the trials (19/126 randomly presented), the red probe will appear at a random location on the
area of the stimulation, starting from the onset of the critical stimulus and remaining on screen until
the offset of the second mask (unconscious session) or blank (conscious session). Thus, its overall
duration will be 129 ms. Subjects will be instructed to press the up arrow to indicate probe detection
as quickly as possible. These trials will be excluded from analysis, and are aimed at keeping subjects
engaged throughout the task.
